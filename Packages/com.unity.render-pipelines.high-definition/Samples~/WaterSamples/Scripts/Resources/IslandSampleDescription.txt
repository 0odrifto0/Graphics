Welcome to the Water System Samples.
The [WaterSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/WaterSystem.html) component allows users to add Water onto their scene. 
Multiple surface type are available, this scene focuses on setting up an Ocean.

If HDRP Asset Settings Helper shows, make sure to enable every properties to get the most of this sample. 

*<size=20>General</size>

• A Water Mask texture is set on the Water Surface to attenuate the swell when closer to the island. 
• A Current Map Texture is set on the Water Surface to slightly bend the swell around the island. The Wrap Mode of the texture is set to Clamp to avoid the texture to repeat.

*<size=20>Exclusion</size>

• A {Water_Excluder}(Water_Excluder) with a specifically authored mesh is set on the boat to exclude water from rendering inside it. 

*<size=20>Shores</size> *<size=20>Waves</size>

• There is 3 different {Shore_Wave_Water_Deformers}(Water_Wave_Deformer_Middle). Each Water Deformer has a {child}(DecalTriggerDummy) triggering a {Decal_Projector}(ShoreFoam) when a wave hit it. Those trigger fetch the height of the Shore Wave Deformers by excluding simulation to avoid having false positive from the Water Surface movement. 
• The Decal Projector has a component "FoamShore" that animates its Transform to simulate the stretching of the shore waves. 
• In addition, the Decal Projector Material uses a flipbook to make the foam more dynamic
• Finally, a very large {Decal_Projector}(Decal_Projector_Wave_Foam) retrieves the foam texture of the Shore Wave Deformers using the <i><color=#e8912b>GetFoamBuffer()</color></i> function to further blend the foam on the shore.
