Welcome to the Water System Samples.
The [WaterSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/WaterSystem.html) component allows users to add Water onto their scene. 
Multiple surface type are available, this scene focuses on setting up a Pool.

If HDRP Asset Settings Helper shows, make sure to enable every properties to get the most of this sample. 

*<size=20>General</size>

• Screen Space Reflection on Transparent is enabled on this Scene so Water Surface receives SSR.

*<size=20>Water</size> *<size=20>Surface</size>

• Each Water Surface has a Custom Geometry type with the Mesh Renderer used disabled. 
• Chaos is set to 1 to prevent ripples from having directionnality.
• Caustics are enabled with Directional Shadow checked to avoid having too much caustics in the parts that doesn't receive direct sunlight.
• On each Water Surface a {BoxCollider}(KidneyPoolMesh) is referenced so HDRP knows where to evaluate Underwater.
• The {beach_ball}(Ball) sticks to the kidney pool Water Surface using the FitToWaterSurface script.
