Welcome to the Water System Samples.
The [WaterSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/WaterSystem.html) component allows users to add Water onto their scene. 
Multiple surface types are available, this scene focuses on setting up a River.

If HDRP Asset Settings Helper shows, make sure to enable every properties to get the most of this sample. 

*<size=20>General</size>

• The Geometry Type uses InstancedQuads to keep a higher vertex density.
• Current Maps are used to guide agitation and ripples flow along the curves. 

*<size=20>Waterfall</size>

• A {Texture_Deformer}(Waterfall_Deformer) is used to increase the height of the river. Prefer using this method over a custom geometry to make sure Underwater works. 
• The Waterfall receives a {Decal}(Decal_Waterfall) with Affects Transparent checked with a custom render texture as a Base Color Map. 
• A Water Mask is also used to dampen the river agitation outside the waterfall.

*<size=20>Foam</size>

• The Water Surface Shader Graph uses a simple difference between the depth of the Water Surface pixel and the depth of opaque behind to create foam on the rivers's border.
• In addition, an extra foam texture is sampled and offseted with time in the graph to make the waterfall foam move with current. 

*<size=20>Caustics</size>

• A {Decal_Projector}(CausticsProjector) displays caustics on the ice wall by retrieving the caustics texture using <i><color=#e8912b>GetCausticsBuffer()</color></i> function in the Water Surface script. This texture updates in real time if you change simulation settings.
• Caustics are also enabled on the Water Surface even though they aren't affected by Current Map.
	
*<size=20>Ice</size> *<size=20>Chunks</size>

• Each {ice_chunk}(IceChunk) sticks to the Water Surface and move with the current direction using the FloatingIceberg script. 
• A disk {Foam_Generator}(Foam_trail) is set as a child of each ice chunk to create a foam trail.
